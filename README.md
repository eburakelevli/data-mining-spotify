-Our goal was to give a person a song he/she would like <br />
-We took a personâ€™s two playlist with 1000 song like and 1000 song dislike <br />
-Analyzed song according to their attributes in Spotify API <br />
-We used Decision Trees and model evaluation techniques such as Roc curve, Gini index, Confusion matrix using Python <br />
-We conducted Association analysis with Hash trees and Apriori algorithm using Python <br /> 
-We conducted Cluster analysis with K-means, Hierarchical and Density-based clustering using Python <br /> 
-As a result, me and my teammate were able to give a person 10 songs that he/she will like with approximately %70 accuracy.
